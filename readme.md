# Jam App

* To compile LESS assets, you need [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
* To start the project on `path/to/dz-jam-app/www`, you need [Bower](http://bower.io/).

To deploy as a mobile app, you need [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/)
and the platform assets of your choice:

* Android needs [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) and the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/).
* IOS needs a Mac. Seriously. And [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/).
